A simple function that determines whether a given number is even for a data type. Unfortunatley there is no easier way to do this :(.

The two files, "even.short.h" and "even.unsigned_short.h", can both be included into any c/++ program.

If you have unused storage buring a hole in your computer you can compile evenmaker with "make" and then run "dontrun" with an argument of the data type you want to use.
Be warned however just int alone is greater than a gigabyte and long long is larger than a petabyte.
